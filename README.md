# fixp-specification
This project contains specifications and resources for FIX Performance session layer (FIXP).


## Protocol stack
FIXP is part of a family of protocols created by the High Performance Working Group
 of the FIX Trading Community. FIXP is a session layer protocol (layer 5).

## Versions

The planned lifecycle of this project is to work iteratively in a series of release candidates. After each release candidate is approved, it will be exposed to public review. Issues may be entered here in GitHub or in a discussion forum on the FIX Trading Community site. When version 1.0 is considered complete, the last release candidate will be promoted to Draft Standard.

### Current approved version: 1.0 Release Candidate 3
Version 1.0 RC3 was approved by the Global Technical Committee in July 2016.
RC3 and earlier specifications are included here for reference only. Pull requests for this version will not be accepted.

### Next working draft: 1.0 Release Candidate 4
A baseline for version 1.0 RC4 has been posted. The
working group encourages users to submit issues for error corrections
and enhancements. The working group will consider pull requests for
changes to the working draft.

### Previous versions
RC3 and previous versions of FIXP, as well as other FIX high performance protocols,
 are available as MS Word documents at [High Performance Specifications](http://www.fixtradingcommunity.org/pg/structure/tech-specs/high-performance-specifications).
 
FIXP is largely based on a designed submitted by Pantor Engineering under the name XMIT. See the original [XMIT specifiation] (http://blinkprotocol.org/s/XmitSpec-alpha15.pdf).

## Implementations

We will post links to open source implementations of FIXP. Implementors, contact one
of the owners of this repository.

### Reference implementation
An open-source implementation of FIXP is available in GitHub project [FIXTradingCommunity/silverflash](https://github.com/FIXTradingCommunity/silverflash). That project also demonstrates FIX standards Simple Binary Encoding (SBE) and Simple Open Framing Header (SOFH).
